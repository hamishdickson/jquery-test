# jquery-test

A quick and dirty webapp so you can manually test changes made to jquery (or whatever really)

Normally issues are reported with a jsBin or jsFiddle example - the idea behind this is you take that code and make sure it works with your changed jquery files

## todo

it would be pretty cool to have a script build jquery, take the jquery.js from the /dist directory and put it in here (I might actually do that)
